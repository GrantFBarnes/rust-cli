# Rust CLI

Rust lib to help create Command Line Interface programs.

From another Rust project run: `cargo add --git https://github.com/GrantFBarnes/rust-cli`

You will then be able to import the lib in other projects using `extern crate rust_cli;`

Functions can be called with `rust_cli::mod_name::function()`
